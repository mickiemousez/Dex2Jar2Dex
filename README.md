## Usage

Once installed, you can use the tools from the command line. Here are some basic commands:

### Convert `.dex` to `.jar`

```bash
dex2jar input.dex -o output.jar
```

### Convert `.jar` to `.dex`

```bash
jar2dex input.jar -o output.dex
```

### Working with Smali

You can also work with Smali files using the following command:

```bash
smali assemble -o output.dex input.smali
```

## Tools Overview

### Dex2Jar

The `dex2jar` tool allows you to convert `.dex` files to `.jar` files. This is useful for developers looking to inspect the bytecode of Android applications.

### Jar2Dex

The `jar2dex` tool performs the reverse operation, converting `.jar` files back to `.dex`. This can be helpful when you need to package Java libraries for Android applications.

### Smali

The `smali` tool allows you to assemble and disassemble Smali code. It provides a way to manipulate the bytecode directly, giving you greater control over your applications.
